In episode #150 of the Ruby Show podcast[1], Jason jokingly suggested that
someone should write a plugin that adds a .there_can_be_only_one method to
ActiveRecord::Base.

I thought that would be funny.  So I wrote it.

Rather than make this a one liner[2], I decided to implement a random(ish)
selection process. This way, objects with a .there_can_be_only_one association
can accept multiple candidates, who will compete for the one available slot until
only one remains.

See the tests or the EXAMPLE file for more details. Oh, and please email me[3] 
if you actually use this in a project, because I think that would be hilarious.

Enjoy,
-Sam
